# Week 2 ML Project - Linear Regression

This project implements linear regression from scratch using gradient descent, and compares it with scikit-learn's implementation.

## Files
- `main.py` — Linear regression with gradient descent
- `main.ipynb` — Jupyter version with visualizations
- `Housing.csv` — Dataset

## How to Run
1. Run `main.py` or open the notebook
2. Make sure the dataset is in the same folder

## Results
- Final weights and bias from custom implementation
- Evaluation: RMSE, R²
- Loss curve visualization
